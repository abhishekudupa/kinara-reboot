Tests in this directory are executed by the kinara build system.
The tests are categorized as follows:
1. C++ tests: which are built and executed per the build instructions
   in corresponding -buildinfo.py scripts (if exists, the
   -buildinfo.py must evaluate to a single string, which contains
   additional command line arguments to pass to the compiler)

   C++ tests are further categorized into:
   1a. Pass/fail tests, where only the return code is examined
       (idenfied by a -pass-fail.cpp suffix)
   1b. Configuration tests, where the output of the test is a sequence
       of key = value pairs, one per line. These are used by the
       kinara build system to produce the configuration .h file (if
       specified) by replacing the '#config_define(key)' directives
       with "#define key value" macros, (idenfified by a -config.cpp) suffix
   1c. Feature tests, which output again, a sequence of key value
       pairs, but these do not go into the config file, instead they
       are used to set variables in the build config. e.g. CXXFLAGS =
       -O3 implies to append -O3 to the CXXFLAGS variable

2. Python tests:
   These can again be of three kinds:
   2a. Pass/fail tests.
   2b. Configuration tests, which are as in the case of the C++ tests
       (identified by -config.py suffix)
   2c. Feature tests, which return a string representing compiler
       flags (identified by a -feature-test.py suffix)
